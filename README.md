# timestamp
This is a Simple Express.js Application that converts the unix timestamp into natural language date and vice versa.

# How to Use?
1) I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
2) If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
3) If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
